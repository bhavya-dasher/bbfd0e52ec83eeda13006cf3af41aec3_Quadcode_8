Exploring Deepfake Detection with MesoNet

"Deepfakes" refer to fake media, like pictures and videos, that are developed using deep neural networks. Unlike fake media created using Photoshop, these forgeries are almost indistinguishable from the real thing.

In this project, we explore the world of Deepfakes using a pre-trained model engineered to detect them, known as MesoNet.
